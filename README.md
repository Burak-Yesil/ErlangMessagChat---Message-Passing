I built a chatroom infrastructure using message passing in Erlang. WhatsApp is a great example of a company that uses Erlang for message passing. When running the program you are able to create different chatrooms and have different users join or create those chatrooms. Once in the chatrooms, users are able to send messages which are saved in the chatroom even if the user leaves the chatroom. Users can also change their user names and any future messages the user sends will be sent using the new username. You can follow the instructions.pdf document in my GitHub repo to test my code out. Sample commands are provided in the instructions.
